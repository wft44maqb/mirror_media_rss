	  <description><![CDATA[Between 8:31 AM and 9:00 PM PDT, we experienced elevated event delivery latency for EventBridge events in the US-EAST-1 Region. Other AWS services that make use of EventBridge are no longer experiencing elevated event delivery latency. The issue has been resolved and the service is operating normally. ]]></description>

	  <description><![CDATA[We have completed our actions towards mitigating event delivery latency for EventBridge events in the US-EAST-1 Region. Event delivery latency for new events has fully recovered and we are processing the backlog of previously published events. Other AWS Services that make use of EventBridge are observing improvements in elevated event delivery latency as well.

	  <description><![CDATA[We previously took steps towards mitigating event delivery latency based upon the suspected root cause and observed improvements in event delivery latency in the US-EAST-1 Region. We have now identified that we are continuing to see event delivery latency due to the component responsible for matching events with EventBridge rules and are taking further steps to mitigate the issue as we work towards full resolution. Other AWS Services that make use of EventBridge may also observe elevated event delivery latency.]]></description>

	  <description><![CDATA[We continue to take mitigation actions to improve elevated event delivery latency for EventBridge events in the US-EAST-1 Region. While we observe improvement in event delivery latency, we are still experiencing elevated latency in the component responsible for matching events and continue to work towards full resolution. Other AWS Services that make use of EventBridge may also observe elevated event delivery latency.]]></description>

	  <description><![CDATA[We have identified the root cause of the issue resulting in elevated event delivery latency for EventBridge events in the US-EAST-1 Region. We continue to observe further reduction of the delivery latency for more requests. We have completed additional mitigation steps that have led to the reduction in delivery latency and continue to work towards full resolution.

	  <description><![CDATA[We have resolved the issue where the virtualization type is incorrectly set in the DescribeImages API call for the EC2 APIs in the US-EAST-1 Region. Starting at 2:43 AM PDT, some images (AMI) returned the incorrect virtualization type (‘paravirt’ instead of ‘hvm’) in a DescribeImages API call. Since some instance types do not support ‘paravirt’ images, this prevented the EC2 Management Console and some EMR jobs from being able to launch new EC2 instances. As of 11:17 AM PDT, the issue has been fully resolved. Instances launched during this time do not need to be relaunched. The issue has been resolved and the service is operating normally.

	  <description><![CDATA[We have begun to see recovery for some of the affected images (AMI), which are now returning the correct virtualization type. We expect to see full recovery within the next hour, at which time all operations affected by this issue should be operating normally. We will provide an update once we have fully recovered.]]></description>
